Numbers displayed are nothing more than a calculated guess of what you might expect for your dive. \n All calculations are based on the values YOU provide in the various tabs and textfields. Incorrect values set in those textfields have direct consequences for the estimates that are given in the plan view. In NO WAY can you take the given plan for granted, nothing beats your own critical thinking and responsible handling. No one other than YOU can be held responsible for any miscalculations, mistakes or accidents on dives you planned either with or without the help of this application. Usage of this app requires a successfully completed GUE DPV Cave course. This app is not in any way related to GUE. This app can contain bugs, rounding errors and other inconstistencies. The Metric system is used internally for all calculations, switching to the Imperial system only changes the display values NOT internal calculations, minor rounding errors/miscalculations will occur"
